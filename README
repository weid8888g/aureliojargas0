This script performs a regex-powered batch search/replace in the phone
numbers of your contacts in Apple's Address Book app for Mac OS X. Useful
for adding/removing local area codes, prefixes and general formatting.

See CONFIG at script headers for details and run this script in Terminal.

    $ ./ab-rephone.py

When running in normal mode (not dry-run), the script will ask you before
making changes to each number, with the following options:

    y    YES, make this change. This is the default action.
    n    NO, don't make this change.
    q    QUIT: save changes already made and quit.
    a    ALL: make all changes without asking (be careful!)

Note: Backup your contacts before anything else (File > Export...)

Note: Quit Address Book before using this script to avoid conflicts.

WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT IF YOU'RE NOT A REGEX NINJA.
